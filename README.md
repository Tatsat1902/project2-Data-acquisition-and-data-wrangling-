Important libraries to be used
• Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool

• NumPy is used for working with multidimensional arrays

The following concepts are to be used with the help of a business use case:

• Data acquisition
• Different methods for data wrangling:
1. Merge datasets
2. Identify unique values
3. Drop unnecessary columns
4. Check the dimensions of the dataset
5. Check the datatype of the dataset
6. Check datatype summary
7. Treat missing values
8. Validate the correctness of the data at the primary level if applicable

Tasks:
Task 1: Data Acquisition and Data Wrangling on dataset 1 and dataset 2

Task 2: Data Acquisition and Wrangling on Dataset 3.
Concatenate combine_ data with Dataset_3. To be Worked on missing values and
outliers.
